			<b><h1>Music From My Life</h1></b>
		<div>
			<h4> For as long as I can remember I've always been a moving body. From a young age I fell in love with music and everything in its immediate surrounding. Dancing, singing (poorly mind you), and over all just having a good time with music. If you ask my friends, majority of them would agree with the fact that I'm a music fanatic, and I wear that badge loud and proud! Below are just a few music suggestions, and just a very small taste of what kind of music I'm in to (which is just about everything)! </h4>
