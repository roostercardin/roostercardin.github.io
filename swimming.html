			<h4> Swimming was kind of a late blooming sport for me. I played other sports, mainly baseball, for the large majority of my life until 7th grade. That year I decided, out of boredom, I would try a new sport in the fall instead of playing fall ball for my town's select team. Little did I know it would end up being the sport that got me in to college many years later. Now I swim for the UMaine Blackbears Men's Swimming and Diving team, and absolutely adore the atmosphere that UMaine has to offer!</h4>
